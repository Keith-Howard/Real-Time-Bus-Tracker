While in the city of Boston you can see all bus stops in a mile radius when given starting longitude and latitude coordinates
Originally the program provided you all of the bus stops between one point and another. This program now will look at a radius around your current location and tell you where all of the bus stops are. 
A request is made to get the longitude and latitudes of the bus stops in a mile radius and then markers are created on the map.

# Installation
To run this program
- you will need a Mapbox token to be able use the Mapbox library.
- download the JavaScript, HTML and CSS files from the repository
- provide a starting Longitude and Latitude set of coordinates in the city of Boston

# Road Map
A future improvement could be to show in real time where the bus is in relation to the bus stop.
